# Manage common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
- A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets. An asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization. Assets can be digital or physical.
- Some common strategies used to manage risks include:
  - Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
  - Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
  - Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
  - Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk
- Organizations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks to help protect digital and physical assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

# Use the CIA triad to protect organizations
 - The CIA triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. It is made up of three elements that cybersecurity analysts and organizations work toward upholding: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
