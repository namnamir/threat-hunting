# Concepts
- A **commit** is a record of what changes you have made since the last time you made a commit.
- To add a file to a _commit_, you first need to add it to the **staging** environment.
- **Branches** allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project.
- By default, every Git repositoryâ€™s first **branch** is usually named `master`. Every repository has a primary **branch** that can be thought of as the official version of the repository.
- **Pushing** the _commit_ in a _branch_ to a repository (pushing changes) allows other people to see the changes you've made.
- A **pull request** (or PR) is a way to alert a repo's owners that you want to make some changes to their code.

# Commands
## Initializing a Repository
- It will initialize and empty Git repository in `<path_to_directory>/.git/` on the local system.
- A new repository needs to be pushed to the remote repository
- Run `git init` with no arguments to initialize the current directory as a git repository.
```bash
### Initialize a Git Repository
git init <path_to_directory>

### Clone a repository to the local system
git clone <repository_address>
```

### Staging
```bash
### Show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
git status

### Add File(s) to a Commit
### Add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
git add <file_name>

### Add all modified files to a commit
git add .

### Add all files start with fil
git add fil*

### unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
git reset <file_name>

### Show the difference of what is changed but not staged
git diff
git diff <file_name>

### Show the difference of what is changed but not yet commited
git diff --staged

### Commit changes (including the Message)
### Commit your staged content (changes) as a new commit snapshot
git commit -m "Message for the commit."

### Stage All Modified Files to be Committed
git commit -a

### Combination of the Last 2 Options
git commit -am "Message for the commit."

### Update an Existing Commit
### After adding a file and commiting it, we can amend a new commit to it
### Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit combined.
git commit --amend

### Remove a file
git rm <file_name>

### Rename a a file
git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>
```

## Branching
```bash
### List Existing Branches
### A * will appear next to the currently active branch
git branch

### Show all branches (with remote)
git branch -a

### Switch to an existing branch and check it out into your working directory
git checkout <existing_branch_name>

### Create a New Branch
git branch <new_branch_name>

### Create a New Branch and Move to (Check You Out on) it
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

### Merge <another_branch_name> to the current branch
### If we are currently on the "master" branch, it will merge <another_branch_name> into the "master" one.
git merge <another_branch_name>

### Delete Branches
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

## Pushing Changes to the Repository
```bash
### Push Changes onto a Branch (of the Repository)
### Pushing changes to the <branch_name> branch (the branch on the remote Repository)
git push origin <branch_name>

### Push Changes onto an Existing Branch (of the Repository)
git push -u origin <existing_branch_name>
```

## Pulling Changes from the Repository
```bash
### Get changes on the remote repository to the local repository (update it and merge changes)
git pull origin master

### pull all changes from the remote repository to the local repository
git pull --all
```


## Configuration
- The file `.gitignore` contains files to be ignored while pushing commits.
```bash
### List the existing configuration
git config -l

### Open the global configuration file in a text editor for manual editing.
git config --global --edit

### Define the author name to be used for all commits by the current user.
git config --global user.name <name>

### Define the author email to be used for all commits by the current user
git config --global user.email <email>

### Store login credentials in the cache
git config --global credential.helper cache

### set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
git config --global color.ui auto

### An example of the file .gitignore
/logs/*
!logs/.gitkeep
/tmp
*.swp
```

## Status and Log
- `git log` displays the entire commit history using the default format.
```bash
### List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked
git status

### Display committed snapshots
### Show the commit history for the currently active branch
git log

### show the commit log as a graph
git log --graph --oneline


### See a specific commit
git show <commit_id>
```
