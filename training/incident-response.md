- Incident response encompasses the people, processes, and technology used to detect and respond to security incidents.
- An incident response plan establishes the procedures for managing security incidents that may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical infrastructure and informational system assets.

# Incident Response Planning
- The incident response plan is used to prevent or minimize disruption of critical computing services, minimize the loss of proprietary and confidential information, and facilitate information exchange among the groups responsible for detecting, identifying, reporting, containing, eradicating, and repairing security incidents.
- To develop an effective incident response plan, an organization must know what assets it is trying to protect. Each organization must answer four basic questions when determining their incident response plan:
  - What are the assets that are being protected?
  - What are the threats to the assets?
  - How are threats detected?
  - How will the organization respond to threats?

# Incident Response Life Cycle

- **Preparation**: The goal of the preparation phase is to get the company team and resources ready to handle a security incident.
- **Identification**: The SOC analyst performs continuous monitoring and active cyber threat hunting. The incident response team is activated when an actual positive incident has been detected.
- **Analysis**: The incident response team should work quickly to analyze and validate each incident, following a predefined process and documenting each step.
- **Containment**: Incident containment is perhaps the most challenging and important decision made during an incident.
- **Eradication and recovery**: The incident response team investigates to find the origin of the incident. The root cause of the problem and all traces of potentially malicious code are removed, which may also involve changing passwords for accounts, hardening systems, and so on.
- **Lessons Learned**: The incident response team analyzes how and why the incident happened and performs a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) against it.
- **Reporting**: The incident response plan should include provisions concerning incident reporting.
