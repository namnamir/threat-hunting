# CISSP Security Domains
## Domain one: Security and risk management
Elements of the security and risk management domain that impact an organization's security posture include:
 - Security goals and objectives
 - Risk mitigation processes
 - Compliance
 - Business continuity plans
 - Legal regulations
 - Professional and organizational ethics

An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:
 - Incident response
 - Vulnerability management
 - Application security
 - Cloud security
 - Infrastructure security

## Domain two: Asset security
Asset security involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data.

## Domain three: Security architecture and engineering	
This domain focuses on managing data security. Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization’s assets and data. Security architects and engineers create these processes. Additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:
 - Threat modeling
 - Least privilege
 - Defense in depth
 - Fail securely
 - Separation of duties
 - Keep it simple
 - Zero trust
 - Trust but verify

## Domain four: Communication and network security
This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications. 

## Domain five: Identity and access management
The identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure. It does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized. This helps prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.

## Domain six: Security assessment and testing 
The security assessment and testing domain focuses on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as “pen testers,” to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor. 

## Domain seven: Security operations 
The security operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred. This includes using strategies, processes, and tools such as:
 - Training and awareness
 - Reporting and documentation
 - Intrusion detection and prevention
 - SIEM tools
 - Log management
 - Incident management
 - Playbooks
 - Post-breach forensics
 - Reflecting on lessons learned

## Domain eight: Software development security
The software development security domain is focused on using secure programming practices and guidelines to create secure applications. Having secure applications helps deliver secure and reliable services, which helps protect organizations and their users.
